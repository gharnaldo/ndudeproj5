# Project: Data Pipelines with Airflow

## Project Description

This Project will allow Sparkify Startup improve the automation and monitoring to their data warehouse ETL pipelines by adding Apache Airflow as tool for achieve this goal.

The source data resides in S3 and needs to be processed in Sparkify's data warehouse in Amazon Redshift. The source datasets consist of JSON logs that tell about user activity in the application and JSON metadata about the songs the users listen to.
