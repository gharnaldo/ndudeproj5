# Project: Data Pipelines

## Project Description

This Project will allow Sparkify Startup analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. They will be able to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.
